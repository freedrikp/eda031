\section{Introduction}

This is a report of the project in course EDA031

\section{Description of system design}

Enligt projektbeskrivningen:
"A detailed description of your system design, both for the server and the clients. Preferably
use UML diagrams to give an overview of the design. (It is not necessary that you list
attributes and methods in these diagrams.) You must also describe the classes, at least as
far as stating the responsibilities of each class.


Also give an overview of the dynamics of the server, i.e., trace an interaction between a
client and the server from the point that the server receives a command until it sends the
reply. UML sequence diagrams are good for this purpose."

\subsection{Server}

Describes the common things between the servers 

\subsubsection{In-Memory Server}

Describes the unique things in Memory server


\subsubsection{On-Disk Server}


Describes the unique things in Disk server


\subsection{Client}


\section{Conclusions}

Enligt projektbeskrivning: 
"Requirements that you fulfill, problems that you haven’t succeeded in solving,
etc. If you have found that the system ought to have more features you should elaborate on
this. Any suggestions for improvements to the project are also welcome"
